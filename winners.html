        <p>
            <strong>The Rio Carnival samba school parade</strong> is evaluated through a meticulous and comprehensive system that encompasses various aspects of each school's presentation. This system is designed to judge the schools fairly and provide a holistic assessment of the overall spectacle of the parade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each samba school is evaluated across multiple categories, including the quality and creativity of their floats, costumes, samba song, harmony, evolution, drum section, and the overall impression. A panel of judges, each an expert in a particular aspect of the parade, is responsible for the evaluation. These judges are strategically placed along the parade route in the Sambadrome, ensuring a thorough assessment of each school's performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scoring system is detailed, with judges awarding scores on a scale that usually reaches a perfect 10. Precision is key, as even a fraction of a point can be crucial. Points can be deducted for various infractions, such as gaps in the parade, falls, or failures in floats or costumes. Synchrony, quality of performance, and how well the school presents its theme are critically assessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Judges are required to provide written justifications for any score that is not perfect, detailing the reasons behind point deductions. This system of transparency allows the schools to understand their scores and appeals, if necessary. After the parade, the scores from all judges are compiled, and the school with the highest cumulative score across all categories is declared the winner. In cases of a tie, specific tie-breaking criteria are applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            This rigorous and detailed scoring system not only celebrates the spectacle of the event but also honors the hard work, creativity, and passion for samba and Brazilian culture exhibited by the schools. It ensures that the high standards of this globally renowned event are consistently upheld.

        <h2>WINNERS OVER THE LAST 3 CONTESTS</h2>
        <h3>2019 - Mangueira:</h3> 
        <p>Mangueira's presentation in 2019 was particularly notable. The school chose to tell the history of Brazil from the perspective of unsung heroes, including Marielle Franco, a murdered councilwoman. This approach provided a unique and poignant narrative, differing from more traditional or celebratory themes typically seen at the Carnival​</p>

                    Mangueira, clear the dust from the basements<br>
                    Oh, make way for your heroes from the shantytowns<br>
                    From the Brazil that becomes a nation of Lecis, jamelões<br>
                    The crowds are green and pink<br>

                    Brazil, my dear<br>
                    Let me tell you<br>
                    The story that history doesn't tell<br>
                    The other side of the same place<br>
                    It's in the struggle that we find ourselves<br>

                    Brazil, my darling<br>
                    Mangueira has arrived<br>
                    With verses that the book erased<br>
                    Since 1500<br>
                    There have been more invasions than discoveries<br>

                    There's deep-rooted blood trampled<br>
                    Behind the framed hero<br>
                    Women, tamoios, mulatos<br>
                    I want a country that's not in the picture<br>

                    Brazil, your name is Dandara<br>
                    And your face is from Cariri<br>
                    It didn't come from heaven<br>
                    Nor from the hands of Isabel<br>
                    Freedom is a dragon in the sea of Aracati<br>

                    Hail the caboclos of July<br>
                    Those who were made of steel during the years of lead<br>
                    Brazil, it's time<br>
                    To hear the Marias, Mahins, Marielles, and malês<br>

        <h3>2022 - Grande Rio Samba School:</h3>
        <p>After finishing in second place for four consecutive years, Grande Rio finally clinched the top prize in 2022. Their parade was a celebration and a defense of Afro-Brazilian faiths, specifically focusing on Exu, a deity considered a messenger between the human and the divine. This theme was politically charged, especially in the context of Brazil, where Afro-Brazilian faiths have faced demonization by powerful movements within the country​</p>
