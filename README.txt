DESCRIPTION:

The website presents the Brazilian Carnival.

It begins with the 'index.html' page, which provides the historical background.

The second page "sambaschools.html" describes the Samba Schools, which are organizations 
responsible for building, organizing, and promoting carnival events, costumes, songs, and allegoric cars.

The third page "plots.html" displays information about the Plots. Each year, every Samba School selects a 
Plot as its main theme and centers its entire performance around it.

The last page "eletrictrio.html" delves into a different type of Carnival event. Electric trios are street 
events where sound trucks slowly cruise around a neighborhood, promoting a public dancing festivity.
